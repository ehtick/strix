"""Per-scan sandbox session lifecycle.

One session per scan, reused across every agent in that scan's tree.

The bundle returned by :func:`create_or_reuse` carries the SDK
``client`` + ``session`` plus a ready-to-use Caido client (already
authenticated and pointing at a temporary sandbox project).

Cache strategy: a module-level dict keyed by ``scan_id``. The same scan
issuing multiple ``create_or_reuse`` calls (e.g., resume after a crash
on the host side) gets the same bundle back. ``cleanup`` is best-effort
— a leaked container is preferable to a stuck cleanup that prevents the
next scan from starting.
