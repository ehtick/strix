    """Finalize the scan — persist the customer-facing report.

    **Root-agent only.** Subagents must call ``agent_finish`` from the
    multi-agent graph tools instead. Calling this finalizes everything:

    1. Verifies you are the root agent.
    2. Writes the four narrative sections to the scan record.
    3. Marks the scan completed and stops execution.

    **Pre-flight checklist:**

    - All vulnerabilities you found are filed via
      ``create_vulnerability_report`` (un-reported findings are not
      tracked and not credited).
    - All subagents have terminated. If any are still ``running`` /
      ``stopping``, message them or use ``wait_for_message``.
    - Don't double-report — one report per distinct vulnerability.

    **Calling this multiple times overwrites the previous report.**
    Make the single call comprehensive.

    **Customer-facing report rules** (this output is rendered into the
    final PDF the client sees):

    - Never mention internal infrastructure: no local/absolute paths
      (``/workspace/...``), no agent names, no sandbox/orchestrator/
      tooling references, no system prompts, no model-internal errors.
    - Tone: formal, third-person, objective, concise. This is a
      consultant deliverable, not an engineering log.
    - Each section has a specific role:

        - ``executive_summary`` — for non-technical leadership. Risk
          posture, business impact (data exposure / compliance /
          reputation), notable criticals, overarching remediation
          theme.
        - ``methodology`` — frameworks followed (OWASP WSTG, PTES,
          OSSTMM, NIST), engagement type (black/gray/white box), scope
          and constraints, categories of testing performed. **No**
          internal execution detail.
        - ``technical_analysis`` — consolidated findings overview with
          severity model and systemic root causes. Reference individual
          vuln reports for repro steps; don't duplicate raw evidence.
        - ``recommendations`` — prioritized actions grouped by urgency
          (Immediate / Short-term / Medium-term), each with concrete
          remediation steps. End with retest/validation guidance.

    Args:
        executive_summary: Business-level summary for leadership.
        methodology: Frameworks, scope, and approach.
        technical_analysis: Consolidated findings + systemic themes.
        recommendations: Prioritized, actionable remediation.
